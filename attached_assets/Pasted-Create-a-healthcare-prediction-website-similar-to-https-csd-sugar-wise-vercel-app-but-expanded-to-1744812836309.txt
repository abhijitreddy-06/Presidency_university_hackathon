Create a healthcare prediction website similar to https://csd-sugar-wise.vercel.app/ but expanded to include multiple disease prediction capabilities. The website should maintain the clean, professional aesthetic and user-friendly navigation of the reference site while adding new prediction modules.

Website Structure & Navigation
Build a responsive website with the following pages:

Home: Overview of the platform with features and benefits

Disease Prediction Hub: Central access point to all prediction tools

Diabetes Prediction (similar to reference site)

Heart Disease Prediction (new)

Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction (new)

Liver Disease Prediction (new)

Diet Recommendations: Personalized nutrition advice based on health risks

Exercise Plans: Customized physical activity recommendations

About/Resources: Educational content about each disease

Get Started: Simple onboarding process for new users

UI Design Requirements
Color Palette: Maintain the primary green (#1b5e20) and teal (#008080) with white backgrounds

Typography: Use a modern sans-serif font family throughout the site

Components:

Interactive cards for each disease prediction module

Clear, user-friendly forms with proper validation

Prominent CTAs with gradient buttons (green to teal)

Progress indicators for multi-step forms

Results displayed in easy-to-understand formats with visual elements

Prediction Modules Specifications
1. Diabetes Prediction (maintain existing functionality)
Keep all features from the reference site

2. Heart Disease Prediction
Required Inputs:

Age

Gender

Cholesterol levels

ECG results

Chest pain type

Max heart rate

Blood pressure

Fasting blood sugar

Exercise-induced angina

Output: Risk classification with confidence percentage

3. Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction
Required Inputs:

Age

Blood pressure

Serum creatinine levels

Albumin levels

Blood sugar

Hemoglobin

Urea

Sodium/Potassium levels

Output: CKD risk assessment with severity indication

4. Liver Disease Prediction
Required Inputs:

Age

Gender

Total bilirubin levels

Direct bilirubin

Alkaline phosphatase

ALT and AST enzymes

Total proteins

Albumin and globulin ratio

Output: Liver health status and risk factors

Technical Implementation
Frontend: Use React.js with Next.js for server-side rendering and optimal performance

Styling: Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS or similar framework

Prediction Logic:

Implement machine learning models for each disease (can use pre-trained models)

For demonstration purposes, you can simulate the prediction logic

Include option to connect to external APIs for prediction services

Data Handling:

Form validation for all user inputs

Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

Optional data saving with user consent

Interactive Features
Risk Visualization: Display prediction results with intuitive visualizations (charts, gauges)

Recommendation Engine: Provide tailored recommendations based on prediction results

Educational Content: Include information about risk factors and prevention strategies

Export/Share Results: Allow users to download or share their results

Responsive Design
Ensure the website functions seamlessly across:

Desktop browsers

Tablets

Mobile devices

Implement adaptive layouts that reorganize content based on screen size

Additional Requirements
Accessibility: Ensure the website is accessible to users with disabilities

Loading States: Include appropriate loading indicators for prediction calculations

Error Handling: Graceful error handling for invalid inputs or service unavailability

Privacy Notice: Include clear information about data usage and privacy

The final product should maintain the professional, clean aesthetic of the reference site while expanding functionality to include the additional disease prediction capabilities. Focus on creating an intuitive user experience that makes complex medical predictions accessible to the average user.
